Use Cases TO DO:
- Specific Model calls to
    - Remove a Node
    - Remove an Interface/Circuit
    - Remove a demand
    - Change demand magnitude
    *** These can all be done now, but require a few API calls to do so

- example script with SRLGs
- Node tags
    - add node tags for organizing/grouping/filtering-to nodes
    - for network graph plot, have option to only show nodes with 
      certain user specified tags

Use Cases TO DO:
- Save an existing model to a file
- Specific Model calls to
    - Remove a Node
    - Remove an Interface/Circuit
    - Remove a demand
    - Change demand magnitude
    *** These can all be done now, but require a few API calls to do s

User experience TO DO:
- save_model call that will save model data to file
- new client code example that uses a save_model call
